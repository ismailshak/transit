## Usage

### List arriving trains for a station

You can provide 1 or more arguments to `list`. Arguments will be fuzzy matched against the list of official metro names, so it's a bit lenient. For example, "courthouse" will match "Court House" and "franconia" will match "Franconia-Springfield".

If a provided argument is too generic, it will be skipped. Try narrowing your argument so that it only matches 1 station name.

```bash
# single station
transit list <station_name>
transit list rosslyn
transit list "u street"
transit list "metro center"

# multiple stations
transit list <station-1> <station-2> <station-3>
transit list courthouse rosslyn "u street"
```
